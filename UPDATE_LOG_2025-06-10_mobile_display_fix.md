# Update Log: Mobile Display Fix for Shipping Rates
Date: 2025-06-10
Feature: Responsive Layout for Shipping Rate Display

## Issue
Shipping rates were not displaying properly on mobile devices. The price was being pushed to the side and not visible when service names were long (e.g., "FEDEX_INTERNATIONAL_PRIORITY"). The fixed horizontal layout with `justify-between` was causing overflow issues on smaller screens.

## Solution
Updated the ResultsDisplay component to use a responsive layout that adapts to screen size:
- On mobile (small screens): Prices display underneath the service name
- On desktop (larger screens): Prices display on the right side as before

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
1. **src/components/shipping/ResultsDisplay.tsx**
   - Changed flex layout from fixed horizontal to responsive
   - Added `flex-col sm:flex-row` to switch between column (mobile) and row (desktop) layouts
   - Added `gap-3` for proper spacing between elements
   - Added `break-words` class to handle long service names
   - Added `flex-shrink-0` to clock icon to prevent it from shrinking
   - Added `flex-1` to the service details section to allow it to take available space

### Key Changes in Code
```tsx
// Before:
<div className="flex justify-between items-center">

// After:
<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row sm:justify-between sm:items-center gap-3">
```

## Technical Details
- Used Tailwind CSS responsive modifiers (`sm:`) to apply different styles at different breakpoints
- The `sm:` prefix applies styles on screens 640px and wider
- Added proper text wrapping with `break-words` to handle long text
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving mobile experience

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test on various mobile devices (iPhone, Android)
2. Test with different viewport sizes
3. Verify that long service names wrap properly
4. Ensure prices are clearly visible on all screen sizes
5. Check that desktop layout remains unchanged

## Result
The shipping rates now display properly on mobile devices with prices appearing underneath the service names, making all information clearly visible and accessible on smaller screens.
