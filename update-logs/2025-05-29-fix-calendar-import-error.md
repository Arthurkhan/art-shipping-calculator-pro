# Update Log: Fix Calendar Component Import Error

**Date**: 2025-05-29
**Task**: Fix buttonVariants import error in calendar component
**Status**: Completed

## Issue Description
The calendar component was throwing an error:
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/components/ui/button.tsx' does not provide an export named 'buttonVariants'
```

This occurred when trying to use the date picker for the shipping date selection feature.

## Root Cause
The `button.tsx` component was importing `buttonVariants` from a separate file but wasn't re-exporting it. The calendar component needs access to `buttonVariants` for styling consistency.

## Solution
Added `buttonVariants` to the exports in `button.tsx`:
```typescript
export { Button, buttonVariants }
```

## Files Modified
- âœ… src/components/ui/button.tsx

## Testing
- Calendar component now loads without errors
- Date picker functionality works as expected
- Button styling remains consistent across the application

## Next Steps
- None required - this was a simple export fix
