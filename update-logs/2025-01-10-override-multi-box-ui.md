# Update Log: Override Multi-Box UI Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-01-10
**Feature**: Enhanced override system to support multiple box types with individual dimensions and weights

## Summary
Refactored the override system to support multiple box types, each with their own quantity, dimensions, and weight. This allows users to ship different sized boxes in a single shipment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Override Data Structure
- **File**: `src/hooks/useOverrideSettings.ts`
- Hook was already updated to support array of box specifications
- Each box has: quantity, dimensions (L/W/H), weight
- Added methods to add/remove/update individual boxes
- Maintains backward compatibility with single-box format

### 2. Redesigned Override Form UI
- **File**: `src/components/shipping/OverrideForm.tsx`
- Implemented multi-row layout with all fields on same row
- Each row shows: Quantity | Length | Width | Height | Weight
- Added "Add Row" button to add more box types
- Added remove button for each row (except when only one row)
- Shows weight calculations per box
- Shows shipment summary for multiple boxes

### 3. Updated Index Page
- **File**: `src/pages/Index.tsx`
- Collection and size dropdowns now completely hidden when override is active
- Improved layout for override mode
- Fixed validation to account for override mode
- Integrated new multi-box OverrideForm interface

## Technical Details

### New Override Data Structure:
```typescript
interface BoxConfiguration {
  id: string;
  quantity: number;
  dimensions: {
    length: number;
    width: number;
    height: number;
  };
  weight: number;
}

interface OverrideSettings {
  enabled: boolean;
  boxes: BoxConfiguration[];
}
```

### UI Layout:
- Each row: [Quantity | Length | Width | Height | Weight | Remove Button]
- Compact layout with all fields on same row
- Add Row button at bottom
- Weight calculations shown per box
- Shipment summary for multiple boxes

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Hide collection/size dropdowns when override is enabled
- ✅ Weight field placed next to dimensions on same row  
- ✅ Multiple rows support for different box configurations
- ✅ Add/remove box rows dynamically
- ✅ Removed subtitle under "Custom Shipping Parameters" title
- ✅ Validation for each box configuration
- ✅ Shipment summary showing totals

## Status
✅ Complete - All requested features implemented

## Next Steps
- Test with multiple box configurations
- Verify backend accepts new payload structure
- Consider adding bulk import/export for box configurations
- Add preset templates for common box combinations
