# Update Log: Supabase Project Reconnection
**Date**: 2025-01-28
**Feature/Issue**: Reconnect app to new Supabase project after accidental deletion

## Context
The original Supabase project was accidentally deleted. A new project "PAJ'Art Painting Monitoring" was created with tables "sizes" and "collection" (singular), but the app expects "collection_sizes" and "collections" (plural).

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Alignment
- Created SQL migration to rename tables to match expected schema
- Added missing columns (width_cm, length_cm, height_cm, weight_kg) to sizes table
- Created proper foreign key relationships

### 2. Updated Supabase Configuration
- File: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- Updated SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to new project values

### 3. Created Migration File
- File: `supabase/migrations/20250128_fix_table_structure.sql`
- Renames tables to match expected names
- Adds dimension and weight columns
- Sets up proper relationships

## Status
- [ ] Update Supabase client configuration
- [ ] Create and run migration script
- [ ] Test database connectivity
- [ ] Verify data loading in app

## Next Steps
1. Run the migration script in Supabase SQL editor
2. Add sample data to test the application
3. Regenerate TypeScript types if needed
