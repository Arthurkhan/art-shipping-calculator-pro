# Update Log: Supabase Project Reconnection
**Date**: 2025-01-28
**Feature/Issue**: Reconnect app to new Supabase project after accidental deletion

## Context
The original Supabase project was accidentally deleted. A new project "PAJ'Art Painting Monitoring" was created with tables "sizes" and "collection" (singular), but the app expects "collection_sizes" and "collections" (plural).

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Alignment
- Created SQL migration to rename tables to match expected schema
- Added missing columns (width_cm, length_cm, height_cm, weight_kg) to sizes table
- Created proper foreign key relationships

### 2. Updated Supabase Configuration
- File: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- Updated SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to new project values
- Created guide for updating configuration

### 3. Created Migration File
- File: `supabase/migrations/20250128_fix_table_structure.sql`
- Renames tables to match expected names
- Adds dimension and weight columns
- Sets up proper relationships
- Includes RLS policies for public read access
- Includes optional sample data

### 4. Created Setup Guide
- File: `SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Step-by-step instructions for getting Supabase credentials
- Migration running instructions
- Sample data structure
- Troubleshooting tips

## Status
- [x] Create migration script for database structure
- [x] Create setup guide for configuration
- [ ] Update Supabase client configuration (user needs to add credentials)
- [ ] Run migration script in Supabase
- [ ] Test database connectivity
- [ ] Verify data loading in app

## Next Steps
1. Get Supabase project URL and anon key from dashboard
2. Update `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` with new credentials
3. Run the migration script in Supabase SQL editor
4. Add sample data to test the application
5. Test the app to ensure it connects and loads data properly

## Notes
- The migration script handles table renaming gracefully
- It adds columns only if they don't exist (safe to run multiple times)
- RLS policies are included for public read access
- Sample data is included but commented out in the migration
