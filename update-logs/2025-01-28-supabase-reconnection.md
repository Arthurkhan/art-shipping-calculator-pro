# Update Log: Supabase Project Reconnection
**Date**: 2025-01-28
**Feature/Issue**: Reconnect app to new Supabase project after accidental deletion

## Context
The original Supabase project was accidentally deleted. A new project "PAJ'Art Painting Monitoring" was created with tables "sizes" and "collection" (singular), but the app expects "collection_sizes" and "collections" (plural).

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Alignment
- Created SQL migration to rename tables to match expected schema
- Added missing columns (width_cm, length_cm, height_cm, weight_kg) to sizes table
- Created proper foreign key relationships

### 2. Updated Supabase Configuration
- File: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- Updated SUPABASE_URL to: `https://lkqekrhbxtbowaswvvqs.supabase.co`
- Updated SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY with new anon key
- Created guide for updating configuration

### 3. Created Migration File
- File: `supabase/migrations/20250128_fix_table_structure.sql`
- Renames tables to match expected names
- Adds dimension and weight columns
- Sets up proper relationships
- Includes RLS policies for public read access
- Includes optional sample data

### 4. Created Setup Guide
- File: `SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Step-by-step instructions for getting Supabase credentials
- Migration running instructions
- Sample data structure
- Troubleshooting tips

### 5. Database Migration Executed
- Successfully renamed `sizes` table to `collection_sizes`
- Renamed `size_code` column to `size`
- Added dimension columns (width_cm, length_cm, height_cm, weight_kg)
- Added missing columns to collections table
- Enabled RLS with public read policies

### 6. Sample Data Added
- Added 3 new collections with complete dimension data:
  - Pop Art Collection (4 sizes)
  - Modern Art Collection (4 sizes)
  - Classic Art Collection (4 sizes)
- Found existing collections in database (many without dimension data)

## Status
- [x] Create migration script for database structure
- [x] Create setup guide for configuration
- [x] Update Supabase client configuration
- [x] Run migration script in Supabase
- [x] Test database connectivity
- [x] Verify data loading in app
- [x] Add sample data

## Completion Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - The app is now reconnected to the new Supabase project

## Notes
- The migration script handles table renaming gracefully
- It adds columns only if they don't exist (safe to run multiple times)
- RLS policies are included for public read access
- The database already contained many collections but most lacked dimension data
- The 3 sample collections added have complete dimension and weight data for testing
- Configuration updated on 2025-01-28 at 06:21 UTC

## Next Steps for User
1. Test the app by selecting a collection and size
2. Try calculating shipping rates with the Pop Art, Modern Art, or Classic Art collections
3. Add dimension data to existing collections if needed
4. Set up FedEx API credentials in the app's configuration tab
