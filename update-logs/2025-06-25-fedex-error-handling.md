# Update Log: FedEx Error Handling Improvements
**Date:** June 25, 2025
**Feature:** Improved FedEx API error handling for service availability

## Issue Description
FedEx API was returning a specific error: "FedEx service is not currently available to this origin / destination combination" but the error handling was not properly parsing and displaying this message to users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Parsing in fedex-rates.ts
- **Modified:** `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/fedex-rates.ts`
  - Improved error response parsing to extract specific FedEx error messages
  - Added special handling for service availability errors
  - Enhanced error logging for better debugging
  - Now properly extracts and displays FedEx's specific error messages

### 2. Error Response Structure Handling
- Added proper parsing of FedEx error response structure
- Now checks for `errors` array in response
- Extracts specific error messages and codes
- Falls back to generic messages only when no specific error is available

### 3. Created Enhanced Single-File Edge Function
- **Created:** `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index-single-file-enhanced.ts`
  - Combined all modules into a single file with enhanced error handling
  - Properly typed FedEx error responses
  - Improved user-facing error messages

### 4. Deployed Enhanced Edge Function
- Successfully deployed version 5 of the edge function to Supabase
- The edge function now properly handles FedEx service availability errors

## Technical Details

### FedEx Error Response Structure
The FedEx API returns errors in this format:
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "SERVICE.UNAVAILABLE.ERROR",
      "message": "FedEx service is not currently available to this origin / destination combination. Enter new information or contact FedEx Customer Service."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Implementation Changes
- Added `FedexErrorResponse` interface for proper typing
- Enhanced error extraction logic
- Improved user-facing error messages
- Special handling for service availability errors
- Preserved all existing functionality

### Error Message Improvements
- Service availability: "FedEx does not currently offer service between these locations. Please try a different destination or contact FedEx Customer Service."
- Invalid address: "Invalid postal code or country code. Please verify your shipping addresses."
- Account issues: "Account authorization issue. Please verify your FedEx account settings."

## Success Criteria
✅ FedEx-specific error messages are properly extracted and displayed
✅ Service availability errors are clearly communicated to users
✅ Error logging is enhanced for better debugging
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
✅ Edge function successfully deployed and running

## Root Cause
The error occurs because FedEx doesn't provide service between certain locations (e.g., Thailand to Indonesia for certain service types). This is not a code error but a business limitation from FedEx. The fix ensures users receive clear, actionable error messages instead of generic errors.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for other FedEx-specific error types that may need special handling
- Consider adding route validation before making API calls
- May need to add a list of supported routes in the future
- Consider implementing fallback shipping providers when FedEx is unavailable
