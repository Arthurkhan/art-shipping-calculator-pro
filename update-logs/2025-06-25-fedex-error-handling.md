# Update Log: FedEx Error Handling Improvements
**Date:** June 25, 2025
**Feature:** Improved FedEx API error handling for service availability

## Issue Description
FedEx API was returning a specific error: "FedEx service is not currently available to this origin / destination combination" but the error handling was not properly parsing and displaying this message to users.

Additionally, the edge function was experiencing 500 Internal Server errors due to inadequate error handling in the code.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Parsing in fedex-rates.ts
- **Modified:** `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/fedex-rates.ts`
  - Improved error response parsing to extract specific FedEx error messages
  - Added special handling for service availability errors
  - Enhanced error logging for better debugging
  - Now properly extracts and displays FedEx's specific error messages

### 2. Error Response Structure Handling
- Added proper parsing of FedEx error response structure
- Now checks for `errors` array in response
- Extracts specific error messages and codes
- Falls back to generic messages only when no specific error is available

### 3. Created Enhanced Single-File Edge Functions
- **Created:** `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index-single-file-enhanced.ts`
  - Combined all modules into a single file with enhanced error handling
  - Properly typed FedEx error responses
  - Improved user-facing error messages

- **Created:** `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index-single-file-fixed.ts` (v6)
  - Added defensive programming with instanceof checks
  - Better JSON parsing error handling
  - Enhanced logging with JSON.stringify for data
  - Added try-catch around JSON parsing to prevent crashes
  - Improved error stack trace logging

### 4. Deployed Enhanced Edge Function
- Successfully deployed version 6 of the edge function to Supabase
- The edge function now properly handles FedEx service availability errors
- Fixed 500 Internal Server errors with better error handling

## Technical Details

### FedEx Error Response Structure
The FedEx API returns errors in this format:
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "SERVICE.UNAVAILABLE.ERROR",
      "message": "FedEx service is not currently available to this origin / destination combination. Enter new information or contact FedEx Customer Service."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Implementation Changes
- Added `FedexErrorResponse` interface for proper typing
- Enhanced error extraction logic with defensive programming
- Improved user-facing error messages
- Special handling for service availability errors
- Added instanceof checks for Error objects
- Better JSON parsing with try-catch blocks
- Enhanced logging to help debug issues

### Error Message Improvements
- Service availability: "FedEx does not currently offer service between these locations. Please try a different destination or contact FedEx Customer Service."
- Invalid address: "Invalid postal code or country code. Please verify your shipping addresses."
- Account issues: "Account authorization issue. Please verify your FedEx account settings."

## Success Criteria
✅ FedEx-specific error messages are properly extracted and displayed
✅ Service availability errors are clearly communicated to users
✅ Error logging is enhanced for better debugging
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
✅ Edge function successfully deployed and running (v6)
✅ Fixed 500 Internal Server errors

## Root Cause
The error occurs because FedEx doesn't provide service between certain locations (e.g., Thailand to Indonesia for certain service types). This is not a code error but a business limitation from FedEx. The fix ensures users receive clear, actionable error messages instead of generic errors.

The 500 errors were caused by improper error handling in the edge function, particularly around JSON parsing and logging.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for other FedEx-specific error types that may need special handling
- Consider adding route validation before making API calls
- May need to add a list of supported routes in the future
- Consider implementing fallback shipping providers when FedEx is unavailable
