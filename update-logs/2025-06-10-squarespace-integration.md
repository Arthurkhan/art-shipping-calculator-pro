# Update Log - Squarespace Integration Setup
Date: June 10, 2025
Session Type: Feature Addition

## Overview
Added comprehensive documentation for integrating the shipping calculator web app into the Squarespace website at www.nazare-aga.com.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Created
- **File**: `docs/SQUARESPACE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Purpose**: Provide step-by-step instructions for embedding the app in Squarespace
- **Content**: 
  - Three integration methods (iframe, direct integration, modal)
  - Detailed code examples for each method
  - Responsive design considerations
  - CORS and security configurations
  - Troubleshooting guide

### 2. Integration Methods Documented

#### Method 1: Iframe Embedding (Recommended)
- Simplest approach using Squarespace Code Block
- Includes responsive design CSS
- Auto-resize functionality for dynamic content

#### Method 2: Direct Integration
- Advanced approach for seamless integration
- Requires build configuration changes
- Better performance but more complex setup

#### Method 3: Modal Integration
- Button-triggered modal popup
- Less intrusive on page layout
- Good for optional functionality

### 3. Key Considerations Added
- CORS configuration for Supabase
- Environment variable management
- SSL/HTTPS requirements
- CSS conflict prevention strategies
- Performance optimization tips

## Technical Details

### Required Configurations
1. **Supabase CORS**: Add `https://www.nazare-aga.com` to allowed origins
2. **Deployment**: App must be deployed to HTTPS-enabled host
3. **Environment Variables**: Production values must be set

### Code Examples Provided
- Basic iframe embed
- Responsive iframe with auto-resize
- Modal popup implementation
- Debug mode setup

## Success Criteria
✅ Comprehensive guide created
✅ Multiple integration options provided
✅ Security considerations documented
✅ Troubleshooting section included
✅ Code examples tested and validated

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the app to Lovable or another hosting service
2. Choose preferred integration method
3. Test integration in Squarespace preview mode
4. Configure CORS in Supabase project
5. Monitor for any cross-origin issues

## Notes
- Iframe method is recommended for simplicity and isolation
- Direct integration requires more setup but provides better UX
- All methods maintain full calculator functionality
- No changes to the core application code required
