# Update Log: Fix Rate Display to Show Both List and Account Rates
Date: 2025-06-10
Feature: Display both LIST and ACCOUNT rates like FedEx website

## Issue Description
The app was only showing account rates but not displaying both the list (regular) rates and account (discounted) rates like the FedEx website does. The FedEx API returns both rate types, but the frontend wasn't properly handling them.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ShippingRate Interface
- **File**: `src/hooks/useShippingCalculator.ts`
- **Change**: Added missing fields to ShippingRate interface:
  - `rateType?: string`
  - `isLastMinute?: boolean`
  - `isAlternative?: boolean`

### 2. Modified ResultsDisplay Component
- **File**: `src/components/shipping/ResultsDisplay.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated to show both LIST and ACCOUNT rates:
  - LIST rate shown as the main price (crossed out)
  - ACCOUNT rate shown below as discounted price
  - Proper labeling and discount percentage calculation

## Technical Details
- Backend was already correctly parsing both rate types from FedEx API
- Frontend interface was missing required fields
- ResultsDisplay component logic updated to match FedEx website UI pattern

## Completion Status
âœ… Complete - Both LIST and ACCOUNT rates now display correctly

## Next Steps
- Monitor rate display for accuracy
- Consider adding tooltips to explain rate types to users
