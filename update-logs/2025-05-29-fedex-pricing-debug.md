# Update Log: FedEx Rate Pricing Debug Implementation
Date: 2025-05-29
Session: Debugging Zero Prices Display Issue

## Issue Description
The shipping calculator is successfully retrieving FedEx service types but displaying $0.00 for all prices. The API appears to be working (service types are returned), but the rate amounts are not being parsed correctly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Debug Panel Component
**File**: `src/components/debug/DebugPanel.tsx` (NEW)
- Created a non-intrusive debug panel that appears as a floating button
- Shows rate analysis with raw cost values
- Provides copy functionality for debugging data
- Can be toggled with Ctrl+Shift+D keyboard shortcut
- Displays instructions for debugging
- Shows real-time status of calculations

### 2. Updated Index Page
**File**: `src/pages/Index.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- Added import for DebugPanel component
- Integrated DebugPanel at the bottom of the component
- Passes rates and calculation status to debug panel

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Logging
**File**: `src/hooks/useShippingCalculator.ts` (MODIFIED)
- Added comprehensive console logging for API calls
- Logs raw API response data
- Detailed logging for each rate including:
  - Service type
  - Cost value and type
  - Currency
  - Transit time
- Logs the full response structure for debugging

## How to Use the Debug System

### 1. Visual Debug Panel
- Look for the blue bug icon in the bottom-right corner
- Click it to open the debug panel
- The panel shows:
  - Current status (Calculating/Ready)
  - Number of rates found
  - Detailed rate analysis
  - Raw cost values for each rate

### 2. Browser Console Debugging
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click "Calculate Shipping Rates"
3. Look for these log entries:
   - `üöÄ Starting FedEx rate calculation` - Shows request parameters
   - `üì¶ Raw API Response` - Complete API response
   - `üìä Response Data` - Parsed response data
   - `üìç Rate X` - Individual rate details
   - `üí∞ Final Rate X` - Final processed rates

### 3. Backend Debugging (Supabase Edge Function Logs)
The backend already has extensive logging. Look for:
- "FedEx rate response data (full for debugging)" - Complete FedEx response
- "Processing rate detail" - Individual rate processing
- "Found rate in [location]" - Where rate amounts are found
- "No rate found in expected locations" - When parsing fails

## Next Steps for Debugging

1. **Run a test calculation** with the debug panel open
2. **Check the browser console** for the logged API responses
3. **Look specifically for**:
   - The structure of `response.data.rates`
   - The `cost` field in each rate object
   - Whether `cost` is a number, string, or complex object
4. **Check Supabase Edge Function logs** for backend parsing details
5. **Copy the raw response** from the debug panel and analyze the structure

## Potential Issues to Investigate

Based on the backend code analysis, the issue might be:
1. **Rate amount in unexpected format** - The FedEx API might return the amount in a different structure
2. **Currency mismatch** - The requested currency might not be available
3. **Missing rate data** - FedEx might not be returning rates for the specific route
4. **Response structure change** - FedEx API might have changed their response format

## Temporary Nature
This debug implementation is temporary and should be removed once the issue is resolved. The changes are:
- Non-intrusive (floating button)
- Easy to remove (just remove DebugPanel import and usage)
- No impact on existing functionality

## Files Modified
1. Created: `src/components/debug/DebugPanel.tsx`
2. Modified: `src/pages/Index.tsx`
3. Modified: `src/hooks/useShippingCalculator.ts`

## Success Criteria
- [x] Debug panel created and integrated
- [x] Enhanced logging implemented
- [x] No disruption to existing functionality
- [ ] Root cause of $0.00 prices identified
- [ ] Fix implemented and verified
