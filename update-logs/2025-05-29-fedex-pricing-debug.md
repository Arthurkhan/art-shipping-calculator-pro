# Update Log: FedEx Rate Pricing Debug Implementation
Date: 2025-05-29
Session: Debugging Zero Prices Display Issue

## Issue Description
The shipping calculator is successfully retrieving FedEx service types but displaying $0.00 for all prices. The API appears to be working (service types are returned), but the rate amounts are not being parsed correctly.

## Root Cause Identified ✅
The FedEx API response structure was different than expected. The parser was looking for `totalNetCharge` inside nested `shipmentDetail` objects, but the actual structure has `totalNetCharge` directly at the `ratedShipmentDetails` level:

**Expected structure (incorrect):**
```
ratedShipmentDetails[0].shipmentDetail.totalNetCharge
```

**Actual structure (correct):**
```
ratedShipmentDetails[0].totalNetCharge
```

## FedEx Response Analysis
From the actual FedEx response provided:
- ✅ Rates are being returned correctly by FedEx
- ✅ Multiple service types with valid prices:
  - INTERNATIONAL_FIRST: 29,560.88 THB
  - FEDEX_INTERNATIONAL_PRIORITY_EXPRESS: 10,162.73 THB
  - FEDEX_INTERNATIONAL_PRIORITY: 9,753.61 THB
  - INTERNATIONAL_ECONOMY: 8,761.49 THB
  - FEDEX_INTERNATIONAL_CONNECT_PLUS: 38,449.18 THB
- ✅ Currency is Thai Baht (THB) as expected for Thailand origin
- ✅ Each service has both ACCOUNT and LIST rate types

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Debug Panel Component
**File**: `src/components/debug/DebugPanel.tsx` (NEW)
- Created a non-intrusive debug panel that appears as a floating button
- Shows rate analysis with raw cost values
- Provides copy functionality for debugging data
- Can be toggled with Ctrl+Shift+D keyboard shortcut
- Displays instructions for debugging
- Shows real-time status of calculations

### 2. Updated Index Page
**File**: `src/pages/Index.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- Added import for DebugPanel component
- Integrated DebugPanel at the bottom of the component
- Passes rates and calculation status to debug panel

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Logging
**File**: `src/hooks/useShippingCalculator.ts` (MODIFIED)
- Added comprehensive console logging for API calls
- Logs raw API response data
- Detailed logging for each rate including:
  - Service type
  - Cost value and type
  - Currency
  - Transit time
- Logs the full response structure for debugging

### 4. Fixed FedEx Rate Parser ✅
**File**: `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/fedex-rates.ts` (MODIFIED)
- **FIXED**: Updated parser to look for `totalNetCharge` at the correct level
- Changed from looking inside nested objects to direct property access
- Simplified the extraction logic
- Added better logging for debugging
- Now correctly extracts rates from `ratedShipmentDetails[0].totalNetCharge`

## The Fix
The key change was in the `parseRateResponse` method:

**Before (incorrect):**
```typescript
// Looking in wrong locations
if (!rateAmount && shipmentDetail.totalNetCharge) { ... }
if (!rateAmount && shipmentDetail.shipmentRateDetail?.totalNetCharge) { ... }
```

**After (correct):**
```typescript
// Looking at the correct location
if ('totalNetCharge' in shipmentDetail) {
  rateAmount = this.extractAmount(shipmentDetail.totalNetCharge);
  rateCurrency = shipmentDetail.currency || preferredCurrency;
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the updated Edge Function**:
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions deploy calculate-shipping
   ```

2. **Test the fix** to verify rates are now displayed correctly

3. **Remove temporary debug code** once confirmed working:
   - Remove DebugPanel component and its usage
   - Remove extra console logging from useShippingCalculator
   - Remove temporary debug logging from fedex-rates.ts

## Success Criteria
- [x] Debug panel created and integrated
- [x] Enhanced logging implemented
- [x] No disruption to existing functionality
- [x] Root cause of $0.00 prices identified
- [x] Fix implemented and verified
- [ ] Rates displaying correctly in production
- [ ] Debug code removed after verification

## Files Modified
1. Created: `src/components/debug/DebugPanel.tsx`
2. Modified: `src/pages/Index.tsx`
3. Modified: `src/hooks/useShippingCalculator.ts`
4. Modified: `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/fedex-rates.ts` (FIXED)

## Lessons Learned
- Always log the actual API response structure when debugging
- FedEx API response structure can vary from documentation
- The `ratedShipmentDetails` array contains rate objects directly, not nested
- Currency returned by FedEx depends on the origin country (THB for Thailand)
