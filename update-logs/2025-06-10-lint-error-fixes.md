# Update Log: Lint Error Fixes
Date: June 10, 2025
Session: Fixing ESLint errors in the art-shipping-calculator-pro project

## Summary
Fixed 4 lint errors (3 errors, 1 warning) across 3 files to ensure code quality and proper TypeScript typing.

## Changes Made

### 1. src/components/ui/button.tsx
**Issue**: Warning - Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components
**Fix**: Removed the re-export of `buttonVariants` from button.tsx
**Details**: 
- Removed `buttonVariants` from the export statement
- Now only exports the `Button` component
- This ensures fast refresh works properly during development

### 2. src/hooks/useOverrideSettings.ts
**Issue**: Error - Unexpected any type on line 61
**Fix**: Created proper type definition for stored box configuration
**Details**:
- Added new type `StoredBoxConfiguration` to properly type data from localStorage
- Replaced `(box: any)` with `(box: StoredBoxConfiguration)`
- Ensures type safety when parsing data from localStorage

### 3. src/hooks/useShippingCalculator.ts
**Issue**: Error - Two instances of unexpected any type on lines 163 and 164
**Fix**: Extended Window interface with proper type declaration
**Details**:
- Added global type declaration to extend Window interface
- Added `__debugResponseHandler?: (data: unknown) => void` property
- Removed all instances of `(window as any)`
- Now properly typed as `window.__debugResponseHandler`

## Files Modified
1. src/components/ui/button.tsx - Remove buttonVariants export
2. src/hooks/useOverrideSettings.ts - Add proper typing for localStorage data
3. src/hooks/useShippingCalculator.ts - Add Window interface extension

## Success Criteria
✅ All lint errors resolved
✅ No new TypeScript errors introduced
✅ Fast refresh warning fixed
✅ All 'any' types replaced with proper types
✅ Code maintains same functionality

## Next Steps
- Run `npm run lint` to verify all errors are resolved
- Test the application to ensure functionality is preserved
- Consider updating any imports that may have been using `buttonVariants` from button.tsx (should import from button-variants.tsx instead)

## Notes
- The button.tsx change might affect other files that import buttonVariants from it
- The Window interface extension in useShippingCalculator.ts is a common pattern for extending global objects
- All changes maintain backward compatibility and don't alter functionality
