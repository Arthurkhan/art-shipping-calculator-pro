**Date**: 2025-05-29
**Session**: Revert to commit 3b3a745bf706ad5e72afe61ae3fcf4b6d91bc303

## Summary
Reverted the codebase to the stable version from commit 3b3a745bf706ad5e72afe61ae3fcf4b6d91bc303 ("Remove unused import FedexRatedShipmentDetailExtended"). This undoes the recent changes that were made to fix rate parsing and transit time extraction issues.

## Reason for Revert
User requested to revert to this specific commit, likely due to:
- Issues with the recent changes
- Need to return to a known stable state
- Planning to approach the fixes differently

## Changes Reverted
This revert undoes the following commits:
1. **Fix FedEx rate parsing to handle LIST rates and transit time extraction** (92020e071472967e5e25dd72b3c30817ea329268)
2. **Update FedEx types to include transit time and delivery fields** (de1e6a1f47b0bf676c5a22ac7d6ee43e6ab2cf6f)
3. **Revert to working version with minimal fix for LIST rate prioritization** (057c58f58627dd9bf463ed998f68703fbfcd8dc5)
4. **Update log to reflect the minimal fix approach used** (4b1fe3291536b44e67d8c5fb0d203a0d7dc8b7e0)
5. **Revert "Create fixed version of calculate-shipping with rate parsing improvements"** (50348b13ebbe0657fb10d9a6315c16dece582e00)
6. **commit** (ed13b997bf7cdaf1035ba9ed61ceb88c31a79e90)
7. **revert changes** (35da8b17ccf0c932803f56f2aa2a7eec6876f2b9)

## Files Reverted
1. **supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index.ts** - Main edge function handler
2. **supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/fedex-rates.ts** - FedEx rate calculation service
3. **supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/types/fedex-types.ts** - FedEx type definitions

## Current State
The codebase is now back to the state as of commit 3b3a745bf706ad5e72afe61ae3fcf4b6d91bc303, which includes:
- Refactored modular structure (Phase 1 of roadmap)
- FedexRatedShipmentDetailExtended import removed
- Working FedEx integration with basic rate parsing
- No transit time extraction improvements

## Next Steps
1. If the rate parsing and transit time issues still need to be addressed, consider:
   - Creating a feature branch for testing changes
   - Implementing smaller, incremental fixes
   - Testing thoroughly before merging to main
2. Deploy this stable version to production if needed
3. Review the previous implementation attempts to understand what went wrong

## Deployment Instructions
To deploy this reverted version:
```bash
# Deploy the edge function
supabase functions deploy calculate-shipping

# The frontend is already at the stable state
```

## Success Criteria
- [x] Successfully reverted to commit 3b3a745bf706ad5e72afe61ae3fcf4b6d91bc303
- [x] All files match the state from that commit
- [x] Removed recent changes that were causing issues
- [x] Documentation updated

## Notes
- This is a clean revert, no merge conflicts
- The modular structure from Phase 1 refactoring is preserved
- The basic FedEx integration remains functional
- Transit time and advanced rate parsing features are removed
