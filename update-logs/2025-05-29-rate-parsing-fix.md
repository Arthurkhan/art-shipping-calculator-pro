# Update Log: FedEx Rate Parsing Fix - May 29, 2025

## Session ID: rate-parsing-fix-001
**Date**: May 29, 2025  
**Author**: Assistant  
**Issue**: Shipping rates always showing as 0

## Problem Description
The shipping calculator was always displaying rates as 0, regardless of the shipping parameters (destination, size, currency). The FedEx API was being called successfully, but the rates were not being parsed correctly from the response.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the codebase, the issue was identified in the `FedexRatesService.parseRateResponse()` method in `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/fedex-rates.ts`. The code was looking for rate amounts in the correct locations, but wasn't properly handling different data types that the FedEx API might return.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Files
- **File**: `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/fedex-rates.ts`
  - **Function**: `parseRateResponse()`
  - **Changes**:
    - Enhanced rate amount parsing to handle both string and number types
    - Added explicit type checking and conversion for the amount field
    - Improved logging to show the original amount value and its type
    - Added a `rateFound` flag to better track when a valid rate is discovered
    - Enhanced error logging to output the full response structure when no rates are found

### 2. Key Fixes Applied
1. **Type Handling**: Added proper handling for amount fields that could be either strings or numbers:
   ```typescript
   rateAmount = typeof charge.amount === 'string' ? parseFloat(charge.amount) : charge.amount;
   ```

2. **Validation**: Added explicit checks for undefined/null values and NaN validation:
   ```typescript
   if (charge.amount !== undefined && charge.amount !== null)
   if (rateFound && !isNaN(rateAmount))
   ```

3. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track:
   - Original amount values and their types
   - Full response structure when rates aren't found
   - Each step of the parsing process

## Technical Details
The FedEx API can return amount values as either strings (e.g., "123.45") or numbers (e.g., 123.45). The original code wasn't handling this variation properly, causing `parseFloat()` to potentially fail or return NaN when the amount was already a number.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with different destination countries and postal codes
2. Verify rates are displayed correctly for all currency types
3. Check that the rates match expected FedEx pricing
4. Monitor the logs to ensure the parsing is working correctly

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Rates should now display actual values instead of 0
- ✅ All FedEx service types should show proper pricing
- ✅ Currency should be correctly displayed
- ✅ No parsing errors in the logs

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the application to ensure rates are being calculated correctly
2. If rates still show as 0, check the FedEx API credentials and account status
3. Consider adding more robust error handling for edge cases
4. Implement rate caching to improve performance

## Notes
- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- No changes to the API interface or payload structure
- Enhanced logging will help diagnose any future issues
