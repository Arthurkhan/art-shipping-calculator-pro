# Update Log: Add Shipping Date Selection Feature

**Date**: 2025-05-29
**Task**: Add ability for users to choose the shipping date
**Status**: Completed

## Feature Description
Previously, the system automatically generated tomorrow's date as the shipping date. Users now have the ability to select their preferred shipping date for more flexibility in planning shipments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend - Add Date Picker to Shipping Form
- ✅ Updated ShippingDetailsForm.tsx to include a date picker
- ✅ Added ship date state to Index.tsx
- ✅ Pass ship date through the shipping calculator

### 2. Backend - Accept User-Selected Ship Date
- ✅ Updated shipping-types.ts to include shipDate field
- ✅ Modified fedex-rates.ts to use provided date instead of auto-generating
- ✅ Updated payload-builder.ts to use user-provided date

### 3. UI Components
- ✅ Used existing calendar component for date selection
- ✅ Added validation to prevent past dates
- ✅ Default to tomorrow's date if not specified

## Files Modified
- ✅ src/components/shipping/ShippingDetailsForm.tsx
- ✅ src/pages/Index.tsx
- ✅ src/hooks/useShippingCalculator.ts
- ✅ supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/types/shipping-types.ts
- ✅ supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/fedex-rates.ts
- ✅ supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index.ts

## Technical Details
- Using the existing calendar UI component from shadcn/ui with date-fns for formatting
- Date validation ensures selected date is not in the past (minimum is tomorrow)
- Maintaining backwards compatibility by defaulting to tomorrow if no date is provided
- Ship date is passed as YYYY-MM-DD format through the API

## Testing Required
- Verify date picker works correctly
- Ensure past dates are properly disabled
- Confirm FedEx API accepts custom ship dates
- Test default behavior when no date is selected

## Next Steps
- Monitor logs to ensure FedEx accepts all selected dates
- Consider adding date range restrictions based on FedEx requirements (e.g., max 10 days in future)
- Add tooltips explaining ship date impact on delivery estimates
