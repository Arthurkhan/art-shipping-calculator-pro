# Update Log - FedEx Integration Fix

**Date:** May 25, 2025  
**Feature:** FedEx API Integration Fixes  
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Core API Payload Fix (High Priority)

## Problem Description
The application was encountering a 400 Bad Request error when calling the FedEx API through the Edge Function. The error occurred at line 197 in Index.tsx during the `supabase.functions.invoke('calculate-shipping')` call.

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on the roadmap document provided, the FedEx API payload structure was not matching the required n8n workflow structure, causing validation errors on the FedEx API side.

## Changes Made

### âœ… supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index.ts
**Modified:** Core FedEx API payload structure in `getFedexRates` function

#### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **Payload Structure Update**
   - Updated payload to match n8n workflow structure exactly
   - Removed unit conversions (now using CM/KG directly)
   - Added missing required fields: `preferredCurrency`, `shipDateStamp`, `packagingType`

2. **Request Configuration Fix**
   - Changed `pickupType` to `"DROPOFF_AT_FEDEX_LOCATION"`
   - Updated `rateRequestType` to array format: `["LIST", "ACCOUNT", "INCENTIVE"]`
   - Added `groupPackageCount` field to both shipment and line item levels

3. **Dynamic Currency Handling**
   - Implemented currency selection based on destination country
   - Defaults to USD for international shipments
   - Added comprehensive currency mapping for major countries

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Improved 400 error logging with detailed FedEx response information
   - Better error messages for validation failures
   - Enhanced debugging information for rate calculation failures

5. **Origin Address Enhancement**
   - Set default origin address to Thailand (TH) postal code "10240"
   - Matches Phase 2 requirements from roadmap

## Technical Details

### Before (Problematic Payload):
- Missing required fields causing validation errors
- Incorrect pickup type and rate request format
- No proper currency handling

### After (Fixed Payload):
```javascript
const payload = {
  accountNumber: { value: accountNumber },
  requestedShipment: {
    shipper: { address: { postalCode: originPostalCode, countryCode: originCountry } },
    recipient: { address: { postalCode: destinationPostalCode, countryCode: destinationCountry } },
    shipDateStamp: shipDateStamp, // NEW: Required field
    rateRequestType: ["LIST", "ACCOUNT", "INCENTIVE"], // FIXED: Array format
    requestedPackageLineItems: [{
      groupPackageCount: 1, // NEW: Required field
      weight: { units: "KG", value: sizeData.weight_kg }, // NO CONVERSION
      dimensions: { 
        length: sizeData.length_cm, // NO CONVERSION
        width: sizeData.width_cm, 
        height: sizeData.height_cm, 
        units: "CM" 
      }
    }],
    pickupType: "DROPOFF_AT_FEDEX_LOCATION", // FIXED: Correct pickup type
    packagingType: "YOUR_PACKAGING", // NEW: Required field
    groupPackageCount: 1, // NEW: Required field
    preferredCurrency: preferredCurrency // NEW: Dynamic currency
  }
};
```

## Testing Status
- âœ… Code updated and committed
- ðŸ”„ **Requires testing:** Need to test the updated Edge Function with actual FedEx API calls
- ðŸ”„ **Verification needed:** Confirm 400 errors are resolved

## Next Steps
1. Test the updated Edge Function in the application
2. Verify FedEx API calls now return valid shipping rates
3. Confirm rates match those from working n8n workflow
4. If successful, proceed with Phase 2-5 improvements

## Success Criteria
- [ ] FedEx API calls return valid shipping rates (no more 400 errors)
- [ ] Rates match those from working n8n workflow
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback to users
- [ ] Origin address defaults to Thailand as expected
- [ ] All required FedEx fields are included in requests

## Files Modified
- `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index.ts` - Updated FedEx API payload structure

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, revert commit `7dc3cf33b5a9d167dd2f77bcfcaedb7caa9b1b88` to restore previous functionality.

**Status:** âœ… Completed - Ready for Testing  
**Next Phase:** Test and validate, then proceed to Phase 2 if successful
