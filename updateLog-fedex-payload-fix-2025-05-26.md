# Update Log: FedEx Payload Structure Fix

**Date:** 2025-05-26  
**Session:** FedEx Integration Critical Bug Fix  
**Issue:** "No shipping options available for this destination" error despite valid shipping routes

## Problem Identified

**Root Cause:** The FedEx API payload structure had a critical validation error that was causing the API to reject all requests:

- **Extra field issue:** The payload included an unauthorized `groupPackageCount: 1` field at the top level of `requestedShipment`
- **Field ordering:** Some fields were in different order than the working n8n example
- **Validation rejection:** FedEx API was rejecting the request due to unexpected field structure

## Solution Implemented

### Critical Fix: Payload Structure Alignment

**File Modified:** `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index.ts`

**Key Changes Made:**

1. **Removed Extra Field (CRITICAL)**
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (causing validation error):
   requestedShipment: {
     // ... other fields
     groupPackageCount: 1, // <- THIS WAS INVALID!
     requestedPackageLineItems: [
       {
         groupPackageCount: 1, // This one is correct
         // ... rest of package data
       }
     ]
   }

   // AFTER (matches n8n working example):
   requestedShipment: {
     // ... other fields (NO groupPackageCount at this level)
     requestedPackageLineItems: [
       {
         groupPackageCount: 1, // Only here - correct!
         // ... rest of package data
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Field Ordering Alignment**
   - Moved `preferredCurrency` to match n8n position (after recipient, before shipDateStamp)
   - Ensured exact field order matches working n8n example

3. **Enhanced Debugging**
   - Added specific logging to identify payload differences
   - Enhanced error messages to capture validation failures
   - Added fix confirmation in debug logs

## Expected Outcome

**Before Fix:**
- FedEx API returned validation errors
- "No shipping options available" message displayed to users
- 400 Bad Request responses from FedEx API

**After Fix:**
- FedEx API should accept the payload structure
- Valid shipping rates returned for supported destinations
- Proper error handling for unsupported routes

## Testing Requirements

**Test Case:** Thailand (10240) to India (10350)
- **Collection:** Hippop'Art, Size S
- **Dimensions:** 40×31×28 cm
- **Weight:** 4 kg  
- **Currency:** SGD
- **Expected:** Valid FedEx shipping rates or specific reason if route unsupported

## Files Modified

1. **supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index.ts**
   - Line ~454-492: Updated payload structure in `getFedexRates()` function
   - Removed invalid `groupPackageCount` from `requestedShipment` root level
   - Reordered fields to match n8n working example exactly

## Success Criteria

✅ **Primary Fix:** Payload structure matches working n8n example exactly  
⏳ **Validation Test:** FedEx API accepts requests without validation errors  
⏳ **Rate Retrieval:** Valid shipping rates returned for supported destinations  
⏳ **Error Clarity:** Clear error messages for unsupported routes or issues  

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix:** Try the shipping calculation with the exact parameters from the shipping preview
2. **Monitor logs:** Check Supabase function logs for improved error details
3. **Validate rates:** Ensure returned rates match expected FedEx pricing

## Notes

- The extra `groupPackageCount` field was likely added during a previous "fix" attempt
- This field is only valid inside `requestedPackageLineItems`, not at the `requestedShipment` root level
- The n8n working example serves as the authoritative structure reference
- Currency handling and all other functionality remains unchanged
