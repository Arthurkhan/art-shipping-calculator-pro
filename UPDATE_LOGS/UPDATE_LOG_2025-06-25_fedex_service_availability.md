# Update Log: FedEx Service Availability Fix - 2025-06-25

## Session Summary
Fixed deployment issues and improved error handling for FedEx service availability between certain countries.

## Issues Identified
1. **Deployment Error**: Wrong project ID in supabase config (coekzxeqsavjmexwjlax instead of lkqekrhbxtbowaswvvqs)
2. **FedEx API Error**: "FedEx service is not currently available to this origin / destination combination" for TH → IT
3. **Currency Issue**: AUD being used for Italy instead of EUR (might be user-selected)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Supabase Configuration
**File**: `supabase/config.toml`
- **Change**: Updated project_id from "coekzxeqsavjmexwjlax" to "lkqekrhbxtbowaswvvqs"
- **Reason**: Was using wrong project ID causing deployment failures

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in Edge Function
**File**: `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index.ts`
- **Change**: Improved error handling for FedEx service availability issues
- **Added**: More descriptive error messages for users
- **Added**: Better logging for debugging service availability issues

## Root Cause Analysis
The FedEx API is returning error code "RATE.LOCATION.NOSERVICE" which means FedEx doesn't offer direct service between Thailand (10240) and Italy (20100). This is a legitimate business constraint from FedEx, not a technical error.

## Solution Approach
1. Better error messaging to inform users about service limitations
2. Suggest alternative destinations or contact FedEx for routing options
3. Log the specific routes that fail for future reference

## Testing Recommendations
1. Deploy the edge function with: `supabase functions deploy calculate-shipping`
2. Test with different country combinations to identify which routes work
3. Consider implementing a fallback mechanism or route suggestions

## Next Steps
1. Research which FedEx routes are commonly unavailable
2. Consider implementing multi-leg shipping calculations
3. Add a feature to suggest alternative nearby destinations that FedEx services
4. Contact FedEx API support to understand service limitations better

## Completion Status
✅ Fixed deployment configuration
✅ Improved error handling and messaging
⚠️ FedEx service limitation remains (business constraint, not technical issue)

## Notes
- The currency showing as AUD for Italy might be user-selected in the UI
- FedEx may not offer direct international service between all country pairs
- Consider adding a service availability check before rate calculation
