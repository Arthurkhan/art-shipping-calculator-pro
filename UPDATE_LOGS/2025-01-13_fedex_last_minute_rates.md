# UPDATE LOG: FedEx Last-Minute Rates Feature
**Date**: 2025-01-13
**Feature**: Add support for FedEx last-minute rates and fix rate discrepancies

## Overview
Adding support for FedEx last-minute rates and fixing the issue where our app shows rates ~1,000 THB higher than the FedEx website.

## Problem Analysis
1. **Missing rate types**: We're only parsing LIST and ACCOUNT rates, but not INCENTIVE rates
2. **No last-minute rates**: FedEx website shows special "LAST-MINUTE RATE" options that are significantly cheaper
3. **Rate selection logic**: We might not be selecting the best available rate from the response

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes (supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/)

#### lib/fedex-rates.ts ✅
- **Modified**: parseRateResponse() method to:
  - Parse all rate types including INCENTIVE rates
  - Look for all available rate types in the response
  - Select the lowest rate when multiple options are available
  - Identify last-minute rates based on rate type
  - Return both primary and alternative rates when available

#### types/shipping-types.ts ✅
- **Modified**: Added new fields to ShippingRate interface:
  - `rateType?: string` - The FedEx rate type (LIST, ACCOUNT, INCENTIVE, etc.)
  - `isLastMinute?: boolean` - Flag indicating if this is a last-minute rate
  - `isAlternative?: boolean` - Flag for alternative rates

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### src/components/shipping/ResultsDisplay.tsx ✅
- **Modified**: Updated to display last-minute rates with special styling
- Added grouping of rates by service type
- Show both regular and last-minute rates when available
- Display savings amount and percentage for last-minute rates
- Added special orange-themed styling for last-minute rates
- Added badges and icons to highlight special offers

### 3. Edge Function Deployment ✅
- **Deployed**: Successfully deployed the updated calculate-shipping edge function
- **Version**: 6
- **Status**: ACTIVE
- **Project**: PAJ'Art Painting Management (coekzxeqsavjmexwjlax)

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Rate Selection**: Now selects the lowest available rate from all rate types (LIST, ACCOUNT, INCENTIVE)
2. **Last-Minute Rate Support**: Identifies and displays last-minute rates with special styling
3. **Alternative Rates**: Shows both regular and last-minute rates when available
4. **Improved UI**: Clear visual distinction between regular and last-minute rates

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with same origin/destination as FedEx website (Thailand → Indonesia)
2. Compare rates between our app and FedEx website
3. Verify all rate types are being parsed correctly
4. Ensure last-minute rates are displayed properly when available

## Success Criteria
- [x] Parse all rate types (LIST, ACCOUNT, INCENTIVE)
- [x] Support last-minute rates in backend
- [x] Display last-minute rates with special styling
- [x] Show savings information for last-minute rates
- [x] Deploy edge function successfully
- [ ] Rates match FedEx website more closely (pending testing)

## Notes
- The rate difference issue should be resolved by now selecting the best (lowest) available rate
- Last-minute rates are identified by rate type containing "INCENTIVE" or special indicators
- Frontend now groups rates by service and shows alternatives when available

## Deployment Details
- Edge Function: calculate-shipping (version 6)
- Deployment Time: 2025-01-13 22:31:09 UTC
- All files successfully included in deployment
- Function is now live and ready for testing

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Deploy changes to production (COMPLETED)
2. Test with production FedEx account
3. Monitor rate accuracy compared to FedEx website
4. Consider adding a toggle to show/hide last-minute rates if needed
