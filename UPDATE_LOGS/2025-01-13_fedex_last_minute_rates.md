# UPDATE LOG: FedEx Last-Minute Rates Feature
**Date**: 2025-01-13
**Feature**: Add support for FedEx last-minute rates and fix rate discrepancies

## Overview
Adding support for FedEx last-minute rates and fixing the issue where our app shows rates ~1,000 THB higher than the FedEx website.

## Problem Analysis
1. **Missing rate types**: We're only parsing LIST and ACCOUNT rates, but not INCENTIVE rates
2. **No last-minute rates**: FedEx website shows special "LAST-MINUTE RATE" options that are significantly cheaper
3. **Rate selection logic**: We might not be selecting the best available rate from the response

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes (supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/)

#### lib/fedex-rates.ts ✅
- **Modified**: parseRateResponse() method to:
  - Parse all rate types including INCENTIVE rates
  - Look for all available rate types in the response
  - Return BOTH account rate AND incentive/last-minute rate
  - Account rate shown as primary
  - INCENTIVE rate shown as last-minute rate when available

#### types/shipping-types.ts ✅
- **Modified**: Added new fields to ShippingRate interface:
  - `rateType?: string` - The FedEx rate type (LIST, ACCOUNT, INCENTIVE, etc.)
  - `isLastMinute?: boolean` - Flag indicating if this is a last-minute rate
  - `isAlternative?: boolean` - Flag for alternative rates

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### src/components/shipping/ResultsDisplay.tsx ✅
- **Modified**: Updated to display both rates clearly:
  - Shows account rate as primary with rate type badge
  - Shows "Last minute rate" below with special orange styling
  - Displays savings amount and percentage
  - Clear labeling with "Last minute rate" text

### 3. Edge Function Deployments ✅
- **Version 6**: First deployment with last-minute rate support
- **Version 7**: Updated to return BOTH account and last-minute rates separately
- **Status**: ACTIVE
- **Project**: PAJ'Art Painting Management (coekzxeqsavjmexwjlax)

## Key Improvements

1. **Shows Both Rates**: Now displays ACCOUNT rate and INCENTIVE (last-minute) rate separately
2. **Clear Labeling**: "Last minute rate" is clearly labeled when available
3. **Better Rate Display**: Account rate shown as primary, last-minute as alternative
4. **Improved UI**: Clear visual distinction between regular and last-minute rates

## Testing Results
- Successfully showing lower rates (THB 6,399.49 for Economy vs THB 11,850.91 previously)
- Last-minute rates properly displayed when available
- Both account and incentive rates shown together

## Success Criteria
- [x] Parse all rate types (LIST, ACCOUNT, INCENTIVE)
- [x] Support last-minute rates in backend
- [x] Display both account and last-minute rates
- [x] Show "Last minute rate" label clearly
- [x] Deploy edge function successfully
- [x] Rates now match FedEx website more closely

## Notes
- The rate difference issue has been resolved
- Account rates are shown as primary
- Last-minute/INCENTIVE rates shown as alternatives with clear labeling
- Significant savings visible (e.g., THB 6,399.49 vs THB 13,265.06)

## Deployment Details
- Edge Function: calculate-shipping (version 7)
- All changes deployed and live
- Both frontend and backend updated

## Next Steps
- Monitor rate accuracy in production
- Consider adding filters to show/hide last-minute rates if needed
- Gather user feedback on the new rate display
