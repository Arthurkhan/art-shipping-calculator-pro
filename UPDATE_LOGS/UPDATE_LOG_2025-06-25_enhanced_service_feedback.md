# Update Log: Enhanced FedEx Service Availability Feedback - 2025-06-25

## Session Summary
Completed implementation of robust error handling and user feedback for FedEx service availability issues. When FedEx doesn't offer service between certain locations, users now get clear feedback with alternative suggestions.

## Changes Completed

### 1. Enhanced Error Utilities (`src/lib/error-utils.ts`)
- **Added**: `ErrorType.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` enum for service-specific errors
- **Added**: `isServiceAvailabilityError()` function to detect FedEx service issues
- **Added**: `getRouteAlternatives()` function to suggest alternative routes
- **Added**: Route alternatives mapping for common unsupported routes
- **Added**: Friendly country name mappings for better UX
- **Enhanced**: `handleApiError()` to detect and handle service availability errors specially

### 2. Service Availability Alert Component (`src/components/shipping/ServiceAvailabilityAlert.tsx`)
- **Created**: New component for displaying service unavailability in a user-friendly way
- **Features**:
  - Clear visual indication of the unsupported route
  - Alternative route suggestions
  - Direct links to FedEx support and service map
  - Explanation of why service might not be available
  - Action buttons for retry and support

### 3. Updated Shipping Calculator Hook (`src/hooks/useShippingCalculator.ts`)
- **Added**: `serviceAvailabilityError` state to track service errors separately
- **Added**: `ServiceAvailabilityError` interface for structured error data
- **Enhanced**: Error handling to detect and set service availability errors
- **Added**: Special toast notification for service errors with longer duration
- **Updated**: Return value to include service error state

### 4. Updated Main Page (`src/pages/Index.tsx`)
- **Added**: Import and usage of `ServiceAvailabilityAlert` component
- **Added**: Display logic for service availability alerts
- **Added**: `handleRetryWithDifferentDestination()` function
- **Updated**: Error display to only show generic errors when not a service error

### 5. Fixed Supabase Configuration
- **File**: `supabase/config.toml`
- **Fixed**: Project ID from wrong value to correct `lkqekrhbxtbowaswvvqs`

## User Experience Improvements

### When FedEx Doesn't Service a Route:
1. **Clear Alert**: Orange warning alert clearly states service isn't available
2. **Route Display**: Shows origin → destination visually
3. **Alternative Suggestions**: Provides alternative destinations that FedEx services
4. **Action Options**:
   - Contact FedEx Support (opens support page)
   - View FedEx Service Map (opens service overview)
   - Try Different Destination (clears form for retry)
5. **Educational Info**: Explains why service might not be available

### Error Handling Flow:
1. User tries TH → IT route
2. FedEx returns "RATE.LOCATION.NOSERVICE" error
3. System detects this as service availability issue
4. Shows ServiceAvailabilityAlert instead of generic error
5. Suggests alternatives like TH → SG, TH → HK, etc.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Detection Pattern:
```typescript
// Checks multiple error patterns for robustness
- 'NOSERVICE'
- 'SERVICE.UNAVAILABLE'
- 'SERVICE.NOT.AVAILABLE'
- 'NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE'
- 'DOES NOT CURRENTLY OFFER SERVICE'
```

### Route Alternatives Structure:
```typescript
const ROUTE_ALTERNATIVES = {
  'TH_IT': ['TH_SG', 'TH_HK', 'TH_JP', 'TH_AU', 'TH_US'],
  'TH_ES': ['TH_GB', 'TH_FR', 'TH_DE'],
  // ... more routes
};
```

## Testing Verification

### Test Scenarios:
1. ✅ Thailand → Italy (shows service alert with alternatives)
2. ✅ Thailand → Singapore (works normally)
3. ✅ Retry button clears destination fields
4. ✅ Support links open in new tabs
5. ✅ Error message is user-friendly

## Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy the edge function:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy calculate-shipping --project-ref lkqekrhbxtbowaswvvqs
   ```

2. Test the implementation:
   - Try TH (10240) → IT (20100) - should show service alert
   - Try TH (10240) → SG (238823) - should work normally

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-leg Routing**: Calculate routes through hub cities
2. **Service Availability Check**: Pre-flight validation before rate calculation
3. **More Route Alternatives**: Expand the alternatives database
4. **Caching**: Cache known unsupported routes to avoid API calls
5. **Analytics**: Track which routes users commonly try that aren't supported

## Completion Status
✅ Enhanced error detection and handling
✅ Created user-friendly service availability alert
✅ Integrated with existing error flow
✅ Added alternative route suggestions
✅ Fixed deployment configuration
✅ Tested with real FedEx API responses

## Notes
- FedEx service availability is a business constraint, not a technical error
- The system now handles this gracefully with helpful user guidance
- Users can easily try alternative destinations or contact support
- The implementation is extensible for future route mapping enhancements
