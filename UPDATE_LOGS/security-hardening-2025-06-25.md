# Security Hardening Update Log - June 25, 2025

## Overview
Comprehensive security implementation to prepare the repository for public hosting on GitHub Pages. This update focuses on protecting FedEx API credentials, securing Supabase access, and implementing security best practices.

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified
1. **FedEx API credentials stored in localStorage** - Critical risk
2. **Supabase URL and anon key hardcoded in client** - Medium risk (acceptable with proper RLS)
3. **Missing Row Level Security (RLS) on some tables** - High risk
4. **No environment variable configuration** - High risk
5. **Sensitive data potentially exposed in repository** - Critical risk

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Created .env.example file with placeholder values
- [ ] Updated .gitignore to exclude all .env files
- [ ] Moved sensitive configuration to environment variables

### 2. FedEx Credential Security
- [ ] Removed FedEx credentials from localStorage
- [ ] Created secure backend endpoint for FedEx configuration
- [ ] Implemented server-side credential storage
- [ ] Added encryption for stored credentials

### 3. Supabase Security
- [ ] Enabled RLS on all tables
- [ ] Created proper RLS policies
- [ ] Moved Supabase configuration to environment variables
- [ ] Implemented read-only access for public data

### 4. Frontend Security
- [ ] Removed all hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Implemented input validation
- [ ] Added CORS configuration
- [ ] Sanitized user inputs

### 5. Build Configuration
- [ ] Updated Vite configuration for environment variables
- [ ] Created GitHub Actions secrets configuration guide
- [ ] Added deployment security documentation

## Implementation Status
- **Started**: June 25, 2025
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: CRITICAL

## Next Steps
1. Complete all security implementations
2. Test security measures thoroughly
3. Document deployment process for GitHub Pages
4. Create security audit checklist
