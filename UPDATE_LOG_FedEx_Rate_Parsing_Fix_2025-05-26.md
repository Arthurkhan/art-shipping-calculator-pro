# Update Log: FedEx Rate Parsing Fix
**Date**: 2025-05-26  
**Issue**: FedEx rates showing as $0.00 despite successful API calls  
**Root Cause**: Main index.ts not using refactored modules from lib directory

## Problem Analysis

1. **Duplicate Implementation**: The main `index.ts` file contains its own implementation of FedEx logic instead of using the refactored modules in the `lib` directory
2. **Missing Module Usage**: The refactored `FedexRatesService` from `lib/fedex-rates.ts` is not being imported or used
3. **Incomplete Refactoring**: Phase 1 refactoring created the modules but didn't update the main handler to use them
4. **Rate Parsing Issues**: FedEx API response structure may vary, requiring multiple location checks for rate data

## Fix Implementation

### Modified Files

1. **supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index.ts**
   - Removed duplicate FedEx implementation (reduced from 25KB to 6KB)
   - Added imports for refactored modules
   - Updated to use FedexAuthService and FedexRatesService
   - Maintained exact same API interface

2. **supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/fedex-rates.ts**
   - Enhanced rate parsing logic to check multiple possible locations for rate data
   - Added comprehensive debugging to log FedEx response structure
   - Improved error handling for rate parsing failures

### Key Changes

#### index.ts Updates
```typescript
// Added imports
import { FedexAuthService } from './lib/fedex-auth.ts';
import { FedexRatesService } from './lib/fedex-rates.ts';
import { Logger } from './lib/logger.ts';
import { CollectionService } from './lib/collection-service.ts';

// Replaced inline implementations with service calls
const accessToken = await FedexAuthService.getAccessToken(clientId, clientSecret);
const fedexRates = await FedexRatesService.getRates(...);
```

#### Enhanced Rate Parsing
```typescript
// Now checks multiple locations for rate data:
// 1. totalNetCharge (original location)
// 2. shipmentRateDetail.totalNetCharge
// 3. ratedPackages[0].packageRateDetail.netCharge
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Verify FedEx configuration is saved
2. Select a collection and size
3. Enter destination (e.g., Indonesia, postal code 10330)
4. Calculate rates
5. Check logs for detailed FedEx response structure
6. Rates should now show actual prices instead of $0.00

## Debugging Steps if Rates Still Show $0.00

1. Check Supabase function logs for "Processing rate detail" entries
2. Look for "shipmentDetailKeys" to see available fields in response
3. Check for "Found rate in..." log entries to see where rates are being extracted
4. If no rates found, the response structure may be different than expected

## Next Steps

- Monitor logs to understand FedEx response structure
- May need to adjust rate parsing based on actual API responses
- Consider adding more fallback locations for rate extraction

## Success Criteria

✅ Main index.ts uses refactored modules  
✅ No duplicate FedEx implementation  
✅ Enhanced rate parsing with multiple location checks  
✅ Comprehensive debugging logs added  
✅ All error handling preserved  
✅ Code properly modularized per Phase 1 refactoring plan
