# Update Log: Fix Override Parameter Preview Display Issues

**Date**: 2025-06-10  
**Author**: AI Assistant  
**Feature**: Fix Parameter Preview for Custom Shipping Parameters

## Summary
Fixed issues where the Shipping Parameters Preview was not correctly displaying custom box configurations when override mode is active. The preview was showing incorrect aggregated data instead of the actual box configurations.

## Problems Identified
1. ParameterPreview shows average weight (4.5kg) instead of total weight (18kg) when multiple boxes are configured
2. Only displays a single dimension set instead of showing all box configurations
3. The aggregated data from `getOverrideData()` is designed for backend calculation, not UI display
4. The 400 Bad Request error suggests the backend might not be receiving the correct data format

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ParameterPreview Component
- **File**: `src/components/shipping/ParameterPreview.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified to handle and display multiple box configurations when override is enabled
  - Shows individual box details with quantity, dimensions, and weight
  - Displays total shipment statistics correctly
  - Maintains backward compatibility with single-box display

### 2. Updated Override Data Structure
- **File**: `src/hooks/useOverrideSettings.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `getOverrideData()` to include `box_configurations` array in the data sent to backend
  - Kept the aggregated data for backward compatibility but included detailed box info

### 3. Backend Compatibility
- **File**: `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/payload-builder.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated to handle multiple box configurations properly
  - Builds correct FedEx API payload for multi-box shipments

## Implementation Details

### ParameterPreview Component Updates
```typescript
// Added support for displaying multiple box configurations
// When override is enabled, shows:
// - Individual box details (quantity × dimensions × weight)
// - Total boxes across all configurations
// - Total weight and total billed weight
// - Proper FedEx API parameters for multi-box shipment
```

### Override Data Structure
```typescript
// Enhanced override data to include both:
// 1. Aggregated data for simple calculations
// 2. Detailed box_configurations array for accurate display and API calls
```

## Testing Notes
- Tested with single box configuration
- Tested with multiple box configurations (as shown in user's screenshot)
- Verified that non-override mode still works correctly
- Confirmed FedEx API receives proper multi-box shipment data

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases with complex box configurations
- Consider adding box configuration summary in the results display
- May need to update the FedEx rate response handling for multi-box shipments

## Screenshots Reference
- Before: Preview showed 4.5kg (average) with single dimension set
- After: Preview shows correct individual boxes and totals
