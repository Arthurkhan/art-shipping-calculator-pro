# Update Log: Fix Override Parameter Preview Display Issues

**Date**: 2025-06-10  
**Author**: AI Assistant  
**Feature**: Fix Parameter Preview for Custom Shipping Parameters

## Summary
Fixed issues where the Shipping Parameters Preview was not correctly displaying custom box configurations when override mode is active. The preview was showing incorrect aggregated data instead of the actual box configurations.

## Problems Identified
1. ParameterPreview shows average weight (4.5kg) instead of total weight (18kg) when multiple boxes are configured
2. Only displays a single dimension set instead of showing all box configurations
3. The aggregated data from `getOverrideData()` is designed for backend calculation, not UI display
4. The 400 Bad Request error suggests the backend might not be receiving the correct data format

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ParameterPreview Component
- **File**: `src/components/shipping/ParameterPreview.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified to handle and display multiple box configurations when override is enabled
  - Shows individual box details with quantity, dimensions, and weight
  - Displays total shipment statistics correctly
  - Maintains backward compatibility with single-box display
  - Added proper box configuration display with:
    - Individual box configuration cards
    - Per-box weight calculations (net, dimensional, billed)
    - Total shipment summary (total boxes, total weight, total billed weight)
  - Updated FedEx API parameters to show correct group package count

### 2. Backend Already Supports Multi-Box
- **File**: `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/payload-builder.ts`
- **Status**: Already properly configured to handle quantity parameter
- The backend correctly uses the quantity in `groupPackageCount` field

## Implementation Details

### ParameterPreview Component Updates
- Added `getShipmentStats()` function to calculate totals from box configurations
- Created separate display sections for override mode vs standard mode
- Shows each box configuration individually with:
  - Configuration number and quantity
  - Dimensions and weights
  - Individual billed weight calculations
- Added shipment summary showing:
  - Total number of boxes
  - Total actual weight
  - Total billed weight

### Visual Improvements
- Box configurations displayed in card-like containers
- Clear visual separation between configurations
- Purple-themed badges and highlights for override mode
- Consistent with the design language of the override form

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Tested with single box configuration
- ✅ Tested with multiple box configurations (as shown in user's screenshot)
- ✅ Verified that non-override mode still works correctly
- ✅ Confirmed correct calculations for dimensional and billed weights
- ✅ Verified FedEx API parameters show correct total box count

## Results
- Parameter preview now correctly shows:
  - Individual box configurations with their specific dimensions and weights
  - Total shipment weight (18kg) instead of average (4.5kg)
  - Total billed weight (19.54kg) matching the custom parameters form
  - Correct number of total boxes (4)

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any 400 Bad Request errors to ensure backend is receiving data correctly
- Consider adding validation to ensure at least one box configuration exists
- May need to update the results display to show which rates apply to which box configurations

## Screenshots Reference
- Before: Preview showed 4.5kg (average) with single dimension set
- After: Preview shows all box configurations with correct totals
