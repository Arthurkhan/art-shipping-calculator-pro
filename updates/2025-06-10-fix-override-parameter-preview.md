# Update Log: Fix Override Parameter Preview Display Issues

**Date**: 2025-06-10  
**Author**: AI Assistant  
**Feature**: Fix Parameter Preview for Custom Shipping Parameters

## Summary
Fixed issues where the Shipping Parameters Preview was not correctly displaying custom box configurations when override mode is active. The preview was showing incorrect aggregated data instead of the actual box configurations. Also fixed the FedEx API payload generation to properly handle multiple box configurations. Additionally fixed validation logic that was incorrectly requiring collection/size selection even when override mode was enabled.

## Problems Identified
1. ParameterPreview shows average weight (4.5kg) instead of total weight (18kg) when multiple boxes are configured
2. Only displays a single dimension set instead of showing all box configurations
3. The aggregated data from `getOverrideData()` was using average weight which could cause FedEx API validation errors
4. The 400 Bad Request error was likely due to sending invalid weight/dimension combinations
5. **NEW**: Validation logic was still requiring collection and size selection even when override mode was enabled

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ParameterPreview Component
- **File**: `src/components/shipping/ParameterPreview.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified to handle and display multiple box configurations when override is enabled
  - Shows individual box details with quantity, dimensions, and weight
  - Displays total shipment statistics correctly
  - Maintains backward compatibility with single-box display
  - Added proper box configuration display with:
    - Individual box configuration cards
    - Per-box weight calculations (net, dimensional, billed)
    - Total shipment summary (total boxes, total weight, total billed weight)
  - Updated FedEx API parameters to show correct group package count

### 2. Fixed Override Data Generation
- **File**: `src/hooks/useOverrideSettings.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `getOverrideData()` to use the largest box dimensions with total quantity
  - This ensures FedEx API receives valid data (uniform packages with groupPackageCount)
  - For single box configuration: sends exact dimensions and weight
  - For multiple configurations: uses the box with highest billed weight as the reference
  - Still includes detailed `box_configurations` array for UI display

### 3. Fixed Validation Logic
- **Frontend File**: `src/hooks/useShippingCalculator.ts`
- **Backend File**: `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified validation to only require collection and size when override mode is NOT enabled
  - When override data is provided, collection and size fields are no longer required
  - This allows users to calculate rates using custom dimensions without selecting a collection

### 4. Backend Already Supports Multi-Box
- **File**: `supabase/functions/calculate-shipping/lib/payload-builder.ts`
- **Status**: Already properly configured to handle quantity parameter
- The backend correctly uses the quantity in `groupPackageCount` field

## Implementation Details

### ParameterPreview Component Updates
- Added `getShipmentStats()` function to calculate totals from box configurations
- Created separate display sections for override mode vs standard mode
- Shows each box configuration individually with:
  - Configuration number and quantity
  - Dimensions and weights
  - Individual billed weight calculations
- Added shipment summary showing:
  - Total number of boxes
  - Total actual weight
  - Total billed weight

### Override Data Fix
- Changed from using average weight (18kg / 4 boxes = 4.5kg) to using the largest box's weight
- This aligns with FedEx API expectations for uniform packages
- Ensures shipping costs are not underestimated

### Validation Fix
- Frontend: Added check for `needsCollectionAndSize` based on override mode
- Backend: Same logic applied to ensure consistency
- Both now properly skip collection/size validation when override data is present

### Visual Improvements
- Box configurations displayed in card-like containers
- Clear visual separation between configurations
- Purple-themed badges and highlights for override mode
- Consistent with the design language of the override form

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Tested with single box configuration
- ✅ Tested with multiple box configurations (as shown in user's screenshot)
- ✅ Verified that non-override mode still works correctly
- ✅ Confirmed correct calculations for dimensional and billed weights
- ✅ Verified FedEx API parameters show correct total box count
- ✅ Tested validation works correctly in override mode (no collection/size required)

## Results
- Parameter preview now correctly shows:
  - Individual box configurations with their specific dimensions and weights
  - Total shipment weight (18kg) instead of average (4.5kg)
  - Total billed weight (19.54kg) matching the custom parameters form
  - Correct number of total boxes (4)
- FedEx API now receives valid data:
  - Largest box dimensions (40x31x28cm) with weight (6kg)
  - Total quantity of 4 boxes
  - This should resolve the 400 Bad Request errors
- Validation now works correctly:
  - Override mode no longer requires collection/size selection
  - Users can calculate rates with just custom dimensions and destination info

## Next Steps
- Monitor to ensure 400 Bad Request errors are resolved
- Consider supporting true multi-package shipments if FedEx API allows different box sizes
- May need to update the results display to show per-box rates if applicable

## Screenshots Reference
- Before: Preview showed 4.5kg (average) with single dimension set
- After: Preview shows all box configurations with correct totals
- Before: "Please fill in all required fields" error even with all fields filled
- After: Calculation works correctly with override mode enabled
