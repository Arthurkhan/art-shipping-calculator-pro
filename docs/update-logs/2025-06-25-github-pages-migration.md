# Update Log: GitHub Pages Deployment Setup
**Date:** June 25, 2025  
**Session:** Migrate from Netlify to GitHub Pages for unlimited builds  
**Issue:** Netlify build minutes exceeded on free plan

## Summary
Set up GitHub Pages deployment to replace Netlify, providing unlimited builds and automatic deployment on every push to main branch.

## Changes Made

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (NEW)
- Automated build and deployment workflow
- Triggers on push to main branch
- Uses Node.js 20 for building
- Deploys dist folder to GitHub Pages

### 2. 404 Page for SPA Support
**File:** `public/404.html` (NEW)
- Handles client-side routing for the React app
- Ensures all routes work properly on GitHub Pages

### 3. Documentation
**File:** `docs/GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` (NEW)
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Benefits comparison with Netlify
- Troubleshooting guide

## Setup Instructions

### One-Time Setup (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://github.com/Arthurkhan/art-shipping-calculator-pro/settings
2. Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. Click "Save"

That's it! The workflow will automatically run and deploy your app.

## Benefits

| Feature | Netlify Free | GitHub Pages |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Build Minutes | 300/month | **Unlimited** |
| Auto Deploy | âœ… | âœ… |
| Custom Domain | âœ… | âœ… |
| HTTPS | âœ… | âœ… |
| Global CDN | âœ… | âœ… |
| Setup Time | 5-10 min | 2 min |
| Cost | $0 (with limits) | **$0 forever** |

## Your New URLs

- **GitHub Pages**: https://arthurkhan.github.io/art-shipping-calculator-pro/
- **Actions/Deployments**: https://github.com/Arthurkhan/art-shipping-calculator-pro/actions

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Push to main] --> B[GitHub Actions]
    B --> C[Build App]
    C --> D[Deploy to Pages]
    D --> E[Live Site]
```

Every push to main automatically:
1. Triggers the workflow
2. Builds your app
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages
4. Updates your live site

## Squarespace Integration

Update your Squarespace iframe to use the new URL:
```html
<iframe src="https://arthurkhan.github.io/art-shipping-calculator-pro/" 
        width="100%" 
        height="800"
        frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

## Important Notes

- First deployment may take 5-10 minutes
- Subsequent deployments are faster (2-3 minutes)
- Check Actions tab for deployment status
- The dropdown fixes are included in this deployment

## Next Steps
1. Enable GitHub Pages in settings (one-time)
2. Watch the Actions tab for deployment
3. Update Squarespace iframe URL
4. Test the dropdown fixes!

No more build minute limits! ðŸŽ‰
